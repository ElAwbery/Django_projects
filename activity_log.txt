Feb 17th 2020:

Created templates directory in root directory, added 404.html file for production purposes. Django renders this when debug is false. Didn't connect it to response path yet. 
Added TEMPLATE_DEBUG = False variable to productionsettings.py
git commit: "productionsettings file added to config directory"
Added DEBUG, DATABASE and ALLOWED_HOSTS variables
Created a productionsettings file in config directory.

git commit: "settings directory refactored to basesettings with devsettings child file, settings_notes added to config directory"
Created settings_notes.txt file in config directory. 
Used runserver with settings variable to check homepage view: python manage.py runserver --settings=config.devsettings
Moved DEBUG variable from basesettings.py to devsettings.py
Added devsettings.py child file to basesettings. Moved DATABASE variable to devsettings file. 

Checked runserver still worked
Updated manage.py with path to basesettings 
Changed settings.py name to basesettings.py

git commit: "manual change back to previous development configuration, nuked all production config"
git commit: "added changes to .gitignore, readme and activity_log"
Tested runserver for homepage view. 

Made manual changes back to old version:
 - nuked productionconfig directory
 - changed names in wsgi, settings and manage.py back to config from devconfig
 - changed directory name back to config from devconfig

Got really annoyed with trying to find how to bring up an old git version in my IDE window and gave up for now. I think it's probably done using a hard reset but by the time I could do that, I'd already nuked my recent commits and didn't want to reset to an older version. 

Added: 
[alias]
    hist = log --pretty=format:\"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]\" --graph --date=short
to git config file in charlieawbery home directory, so that I could view git history in bash. Also added it to Django_portfolio git config on Mac.  

Did $ git reset HEAD~2  
I thought this would change my cd back to a previous state but it didn't.  

Read Two Scoops chapter 5 on using multiple settings file and decided to change the hierarchy again, to avoid bug creation problems in separate dev and production directories. 

git commit: "production and dev config folders separated. devconfig removed from version control"
Tested runserver for homepage view. 
Renamed config copy to productionconfig. 
Updated manage.py with devconfig name.
Copied config folder. Renamed config folder to devconfig and updated name in settings and wsgi files.

Feb 15th 2020:
Added .vscode folder to .gitignore

In management app, the apps.py file had automatically configured a class called portfolioconfig, with name portfolio. This was because I named the original command line app setup 'portfolio.' I later changed it to 'management'. So I rewrote the apps.py file: changed the class name to managementconfig and named it management. 

Committed charlieawbery directory to new git repo ("first commit charlieawbery")

Added following to .gitignore:
env
*.DS_Store
*.pyc
__pycache__

.venv

Set up .venv folder for all venvs inside top level
Made first level config directory for init, settings, urls and wsgi
Created gitignore, readme and requirements.txt files in root directory
Moved manage.py doc to top level charlieawbery repository root
Moved directory contents and files to create desired project hierarchy
Created charlieawbery repository root directory for new django template.
