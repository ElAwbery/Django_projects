Feb 15th 2020:
Added .vscode folder to .gitignore

In management app, the apps.py file had automatically configured a class called portfolioconfig, with name portfolio. This was because I named the original command line app setup 'portfolio.' I later changed it to 'management'. So I rewrote the apps.py file: changed the class name to managementconfig and named it management. 

Committed charlieawbery directory to new git repo ("first commit charlieawbery")

Added following to .gitignore:
env
*.DS_Store
*.pyc
__pycache__

.venv

Set up .venv folder for all venvs inside top level
Made first level config directory for init, settings, urls and wsgi
Created gitignore, readme and requirements.txt files in root directory
Moved manage.py doc to top level charlieawbery repository root
Moved directory contents and files to create desired project hierarchy
Created charlieawbery repository root directory for new django template.
